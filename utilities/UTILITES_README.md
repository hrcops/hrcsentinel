This directory includes scripts (many almost completely redundant!) that I wrote
for monitoring specific CAPs throughout the HRC anomaly recovery process. I am keeping them here
for archival/referential purposes, but they are not intended for wide use (and in fact won't work if run from this directory - you must place them back in the `/hrcsentinel/` directory!)
